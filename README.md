The Fifteen Game is a Java application that allows you to play the classic sliding puzzle game known as the "15 Puzzle." The objective of the game is to arrange the numbered tiles in ascending order, starting from the top-left corner and ending with an empty space in the bottom-right corner. You can only move the tiles adjacent to the empty space by sliding them into it.
